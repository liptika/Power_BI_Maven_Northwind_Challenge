# ✔General Insights:

1.The total number of orders is 830, with a gross revenue of 1.35 million. On average, it takes approximately 8 days to deliver an order after it is placed. The rate of shipping orders within the required time is 95.54%. Additionally, the rate of customers who return to place a second order is 96.70%. The average price of an order is 1.63 thousand, with a minimum of 12.5 and a maximum of 17.25 thousand.

2.The shipping company United Package contributed the most, accounting for 42.28% of the shipping goods, followed by Federal Shipping and Speedy Express.

3.The most sold product is “Côte de Blaye” followed by “Thüringer Rostbratwurst”, “Raclette Courdavault” and “Camembert Pierrot”.

4.The most active employee who contributed to most sales is Margaret Peacock followed by Janet Leverling, Nancy Davolio and Andrew Fuller.

5.The highest selling product category is beverages, followed by dairy products, meat and poultry, and confections.

6.The total sales for the months of January to May were comparatively higher in 2015 than in 2014, while the total sales for the months of June to December were comparatively higher in 2014 than in 2013.

7.Northwind Traders sold its products primarily in the USA, followed by Germany, Austria, Brazil, France, and other countries.

# ✔Deeper Insights:

1.There is a significant growth in total sales from the 3rd quarter of 2013 to the last quarter of 2013. The quarterly growth rates were 8.28% from the 2nd to the 3rd quarter of 2014, 17.28% from the 3rd to last quarter of 2014, and 63.73% from the last quarter of 2014 to the 1st quarter of 2015.

Since the dataset only includes data for half of the 2nd quarter, the graph currently shows a 50.98% drop in sales. It is important to note that this problem can be resolved with sufficient data.

2.Interestingly, United Package, being the most active shipper, contributed the highest percentage of on-time delivered orders, accounting for 39.09% of the total, as well as the highest percentage of late delivered orders, accounting for 43.24% of the total.

Federal shipping is overall a good performer contributing the lowest percentage of late delivered orders, accounting for 24.32% of total.
